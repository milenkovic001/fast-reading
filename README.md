# Fast Reading ⚡📖

A speed reading training application that helps you improve your reading speed using scientifically proven techniques.

## 🎯 About the Application

Fast Reading is an application designed to help you master the skill of speed reading through controlled text display. The app shows words from text one by one in large font, allowing you to focus on each word without the need for your eyes to move left-right across the text.

## 🧠 Scientific Foundation

This application is based on techniques popularized by Tony Buzan in his book "Speed Reading". Buzan highlighted one of the main problems that slow down reading:

**The Regression Problem** - people often unconsciously move their eyes backward through text they have already read. This habit significantly slows reading speed and reduces concentration.

### How Fast Reading solves this problem:

- **Eliminates regression**: When text is displayed word by word, there's no possibility of going backward
- **Forces focus**: Your attention is directed to one word at a time
- **Controlled speed**: You can gradually increase speed as your skills improve
- **Comfort zone**: The app encourages you to constantly step slightly outside your comfort zone to progress

## ✨ Features

- 📝 **Custom text input** - Copy any text you want to read
- 🎲 **Random texts** - Use built-in texts for practice
- ⚙️ **Adjustable speed** - Control word display speed (words per minute)
- 🎨 **Large font** - Words are displayed in large, clear font for easier reading
- 📈 **Gradual speed increase** - Train by gradually increasing your reading speed

## 🎯 How to Use the Application

1. **Insert text**: Copy the text you want to read into the text field
2. **Or choose random text**: Click the random text button
3. **Adjust speed**: Choose a speed that suits you (start with 200-300 words per minute)
4. **Start reading**: Click start and focus on the words that appear
5. **Increase speed**: When you feel comfortable, increase speed by 25-50 wpm

## 📚 Speed Reading Tips

- **Start slowly**: Begin with a speed that feels comfortable
- **Practice regularly**: 10-15 minutes daily is enough for progress
- **Don't go back**: Trust the process and don't try to return to previous words
- **Increase gradually**: Increase speed by 10-15% when you master the current level
- **Focus on comprehension**: Speed is only good if you maintain understanding
